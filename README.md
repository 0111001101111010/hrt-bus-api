hrt-bus-api
===========

Python scripts and Flask app that transform, store, and expose HRT Bus data through a RESTful API. API's don't make for good demos, so we've created an HRT Bus Finder App.

demo site: http://lit-inlet-3610.herokuapp.com

Problem
===========================
HRT exposes the real time location of there buses at `ftp://216.54.15.3/Anrd/hrtrtf.txt`. Unfortunately, this file gives us less than five minutes of data and most of the entries don't have a route number associated with them. Riders lookup bus information by route number, so without it, the data isn't very useful.

Solution
===========================
### Transform and Store

### Expose
