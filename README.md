hrt-bus-api
===========

Python scripts that transform and store HRT Bus Data and a Flask application that exposes the data through an RESTful API.

demo site: http://lit-inlet-3610.herokuapp.com

Problem
===========================
HRT exposes the real time location of there buses at `ftp://216.54.15.3/Anrd/hrtrtf.txt`. Unfortunately, this file gives us less than five minutes of data and most of the entries don't have a route number associated with them. Riders lookup bus information by route number, so without it, the data isn't very useful.
